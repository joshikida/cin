        <h1>Biology - Ms. Reid (3 responses)</h1><p>In Biology taught by Ms. Reid, students highlighted learnings on cell functions, genetics, human systems, and macromolecules, with a focus on memorization-based topics like organ systems. They found the interactive assignments and labs helpful for visualizing concepts and appreciated detailed diagrams in videos. Most students found the course intellectually challenging, with fair evaluation and helpful feedback, although some felt it was easier than other courses. Students spent 0-1 hours on homework and found tests fair but project assessments strict on details. Favorite moments included labs and lab reports, with enthusiasm for Ms. Reid's storytelling. The course was recommended for those interested in biology and with a mature approach to learning. Overall, the course was deemed informative and engaging, contributing positively to students' knowledge and interest in the subject.</p><div class='q_table'><h2>What are the most important things that you learned in this course?</h2><table><tr><th>Comments</th></tr><tr><td>We learned about cell organelles and functions of the cell (such as cell transport and mitosis), genetics/inheritance, human systems, and macromolecules. To me, the most significant portions were those about the human systems and functions of the cell. Either that or they're the ones I remember with the most clarity.</td></tr><tr><td>This course gives a very broad overview of a lot of basic topics in biology, like human systems, photosynthesis, reproduction, etc. Towards the end of the year, we focused mostly on organ systems – which is what I personally remember the most of. </td></tr><tr><td>I think evolution and genetics were the most important units we learned last year.</td></tr></table></div><div class='q_table'><h2>Briefly describe how aspects of this course (lectures, discussions, labs, assignments, etc.) contributed to your learning.</h2><table><tr><th>Comments</th></tr><tr><td>The in-class interactive assignments helped me visualize trickier concepts, and the slides were informative. The labs were genuinely engaging, especially for kinesthetic learners, and it was interesting to see the concepts we were talking about in class represented in real life.</td></tr><tr><td>This course is definitely more lecture-based – most of the time the teacher will go through a slideshow with the class on today's topic, and then if there's time left you can start on the homework. Other days, we'll do simple labs (like pH indicators or starch indicators) and write up a lab report as homework. Like I said, biology is very memorization-based, so I definitely think that doing slides in class helps with gaining the knowledge you need to ace the tests. </td></tr><tr><td>The videos we watched in class always included detailed diagrams which really made it easy for me to understand the topics. I loved ever lab and lab report we did, it really helped me with my scientific writing and it was a lot of fun. I don’t think the lectures were perfect for me, but ever other aspect contributed to my knowledge of the subject as a whole.</td></tr></table></div><div class='q_table'><h2>Please respond to the following:</h2> <table><tr><th></th><th>Mean</th><th>Median</th><th>Strongly Disagree</th><th>Disagree</th><th>Neutral</th><th>Agree</th><th>Strongly Agree</th></tr><tr><td>This course challenged me intellectually.</td><td>3.0</td><td>3.0</td><td>0.0%</td><td>0.0%</td><td>100.0%</td><td>0.0%</td><td>0.0%</td></tr><tr><td>I understood the standards for success on assignments.</td><td>4.67</td><td>5.0</td><td>0.0%</td><td>0.0%</td><td>0.0%</td><td>33.33%</td><td>66.67%</td></tr><tr><td>Class time helped me succeed.</td><td>4.0</td><td>4.0</td><td>0.0%</td><td>0.0%</td><td>0.0%</td><td>100.0%</td><td>0.0%</td></tr><tr><td>I received useful feedback on my work.</td><td>4.33</td><td>4.0</td><td>0.0%</td><td>0.0%</td><td>0.0%</td><td>66.67%</td><td>33.33%</td></tr><tr><td>My work was evaluated fairly.</td><td>4.33</td><td>5.0</td><td>0.0%</td><td>0.0%</td><td>33.33%</td><td>0.0%</td><td>66.67%</td></tr><tr><td>This course was easier than my other courses</td><td>3.67</td><td>4.0</td><td>0.0%</td><td>0.0%</td><td>33.33%</td><td>66.67%</td><td>0.0%</td></tr><tr><td>This course prepared me for the associated AP (if applicable)</td><td>3.0</td><td>3.0</td><td>0.0%</td><td>0.0%</td><td>100.0%</td><td>0.0%</td><td>0.0%</td></tr><tr><td>The instructor was available and helpful outside of class.</td><td>4.0</td><td>4.0</td><td>0.0%</td><td>0.0%</td><td>0.0%</td><td>100.0%</td><td>0.0%</td></tr><tr><td>Overall, this was an excellent course.</td><td>4.33</td><td>4.0</td><td>0.0%</td><td>0.0%</td><td>0.0%</td><td>66.67%</td><td>33.33%</td></tr><tr><td>I was interested in the subject prior to starting the course</td><td>3.67</td><td>5.0</td><td>33.33%</td><td>0.0%</td><td>0.0%</td><td>0.0%</td><td>66.67%</td></tr><tr><td>The course increased my interest in the subject</td><td>4.33</td><td>5.0</td><td>0.0%</td><td>0.0%</td><td>33.33%</td><td>0.0%</td><td>66.67%</td></tr></table></div><div class='q_table'><h2>Outside of classes, many hours did you generally spend to complete/study for one...</h2> <table><tr><th></th><th>0-1 hours</th><th>1-2 hours</th><th>2-4 hours</th><th>4-6 hours</th><th>6-10 hours</th><th>10-15 hours</th><th>15+ hours</th><th>N/A</th></tr><tr><td>Homework</td><td>100.0%</td><td>0.0%</td><td>0.0%</td><td>0.0%</td><td>0.0%</td><td>0.0%</td><td>0.0%</td><td>0.0%</td></tr><tr><td>Quiz</td><td>66.67%</td><td>33.33%</td><td>0.0%</td><td>0.0%</td><td>0.0%</td><td>0.0%</td><td>0.0%</td><td>0.0%</td></tr><tr><td>Test</td><td>0.0%</td><td>100.0%</td><td>0.0%</td><td>0.0%</td><td>0.0%</td><td>0.0%</td><td>0.0%</td><td>0.0%</td></tr><tr><td>Project/Lab/Essay</td><td>0.0%</td><td>66.67%</td><td>33.33%</td><td>0.0%</td><td>0.0%</td><td>0.0%</td><td>0.0%</td><td>0.0%</td></tr><tr><td>Graded Discussion</td><td>66.67%</td><td>0.0%</td><td>0.0%</td><td>0.0%</td><td>0.0%</td><td>0.0%</td><td>0.0%</td><td>33.33%</td></tr></table></div><div class='q_table'><h2>Briefly comment on the difficulty of the course's (assessments/homework/etc) relative to your background, experience, and performance in other courses.</h2><table><tr><th>Comments</th></tr><tr><td>I think Biology was my second-highest grade. The tests are graded fairly, but on the project assessments there were a lot of points taken off for minute details. The homework was easy, as long as you pay attention in class, and as long as you make a basic study guide for each test you'll be fine.</td></tr><tr><td>I had never taken biology before, but because it's a course that focuses on having you memorize things, I would say that you don't really need any prior experience to do well as long as you invest the time outside of class to review material. </td></tr><tr><td>I honestly did not think that biology was a hard course at all, but many would probably disagree with me. Compared to Math III H, the homework was significantly less. Regardless, this was definitely my favorite class.</td></tr></table></div><div class='q_table'><h2>What were your favorite moments from the course?</h2><table><tr><th>Comments</th></tr><tr><td>I liked the sickle-cell anemia gel electrophoresis lab.</td></tr><tr><td>Ms. Reid's stories! She tells lots of interesting stories in class, and it definitely spices things up. </td></tr><tr><td>My favorite moments were the lab and lab reports. I really enjoyed drawing diagrams for my reports and writing about all of my findings. It didn’t even feel like homework for me.</td></tr></table></div><div class='q_table'><h2>Who is this course best for?</h2><table><tr><th>Comments</th></tr><tr><td>People who like learning about how the world works, and especially living things. Also people who are mature enough to not giggle at the mention of certain organs.</td></tr><tr><td>I think everyone needs a basic understanding of biological processes, anatomy, and evolution.</td></tr></table></div><div class='q_table'><h2>Additional comments</h2><table><tr><th>Comments</th></tr></table></div>
