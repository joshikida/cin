        <h1>(H) Advanced Topics in Biology - Ms. Souza (1 responses)</h1><p>Ms. Souza's Advanced Topics in Biology course was highly valued by the students. Many highlighted learning to read journal articles, biotechnology techniques, and traditional biological concepts as key takeaways. The hands-on labs were particularly praised for enhancing understanding, especially with techniques like PCR and restriction enzyme digests. Feedback on assignments, availability of the instructor outside class, and course interest received perfect ratings.

However, sometimes the highest level (4) requires a lot of extra time and work outside of class, more so than other courses despite always getting perfect grades.

        <h1>(H) Advanced Topics in Computer Science - Ms. Kashiwada (2 responses)</h1><p>In the Advanced Topics in Computer Science course taught by Ms. Kashiwada, students learned about various computer science topics like object-oriented programming, graph theory, and machine learning. The course had a balanced mix of lectures and lab work, with small class sizes facilitating collaborative learning. Students felt intellectually challenged by the course, and they found the instructor to be helpful and available outside of class. The workload was manageable, with most students spending 1-2 hours on homework and quizzes, and 2-4 hours studying for tests.

Thus, even though one-half of the class is lecture-based in that there is a prepared slideshow, the small class size easily opens itself up to collaborative discussion. Honestly, talking through the material with my peers really helped me clear up any misunderstanding I had about the concepts.
The other half of the class is reserved for "lab days," which are work periods in which you can discuss the assigned labs with your classmates. Labs are essentially problem sets that you have around 1.5-2 weeks to complete. Early on in the year they are mostly coding, but later on they have a mix of theory and coding. Definitely take advantage of these; many of the labs can be quite tricky to solve, and brainstorming ideas in a small group usually leads to a solution much faster than trying to figure it out yourself.</td></tr><tr><td>lectures were extremely useful, transforming a difficult subject and often incomprehensible textbook into a known quantity. labs were useful as a self-guided learning experience and allowed us to understand, work with, extend the concepts we were learning. quizzes and tests were effective in testing content. </td></tr></table></div><div class='q_table'><h2>Please respond to the following:</h2> <table><tr><th></th><th>Mean</th><th>Median</th><th>Strongly Disagree</th><th>Disagree</th><th>Neutral</th><th>Agree</th><th>Strongly Agree</th></tr><tr><td>This course challenged me intellectually.</td><td>4.0</td><td>4.0</td><td>0.0%</td><td>0.0%</td><td>0.0%</td><td>100.0%</td><td>0.0%</td></tr><tr><td>I understood the standards for success on assignments.</td><td>4.5</td><td>4.5</td><td>0.0%</td><td>0.0%</td><td>0.0%</td><td>50.0%</td><td>50.0%</td></tr><tr><td>Class time helped me succeed.</td><td>5.0</td><td>5.0</td><td>0.0%</td><td>0.0%</td><td>0.0%</td><td>0.0%</td><td>100.0%</td></tr><tr><td>I received useful feedback on my work.</td><td>4.5</td><td>4.5</td><td>0.0%</td><td>0.0%</td><td>0.0%</td><td>50.0%</td><td>50.0%</td></tr><tr><td>My work was evaluated fairly.</td><td>4.5</td><td>4.5</td><td>0.0%</td><td>0.0%</td><td>0.0%</td><td>50.0%</td><td>50.0%</td></tr><tr><td>This course was easier than my other courses</td><td>2.0</td><td>2.0</td><td>0.0%</td><td>100.0%</td><td>0.0%</td><td>0.0%</td><td>0.0%</td></tr><tr><td>This course prepared me for the associated AP (if applicable)</td><td>3.0</td><td>3.0</td><td>0.0%</td><td>0.0%</td><td>100.0%</td><td>0.0%</td><td>0.0%</td></tr><tr><td>The instructor was available and helpful outside of class.</td><td>4.5</td><td>4.5</td><td>0.0%</td><td>0.0%</td><td>0.0%</td><td>50.0%</td><td>50.0%</td></tr><tr><td>Overall, this was an excellent course.</td><td>4.5</td><td>4.5</td><td>0.0%</td><td>0.0%</td><td>0.0%</td><td>50.0%</td><td>50.0%</td></tr><tr><td>I was interested in the subject prior to starting the course</td><td>4.5</td><td>4.5</td><td>0.0%</td><td>0.0%</td><td>0.0%</td><td>50.0%</td><td>50.0%</td></tr><tr><td>The course increased my interest in the subject</td><td>4.5</td><td>4.5</td><td>0.0%</td><td>0.0%</td><td>0.0%</td><td>50.0%</td><td>50.0%</td></tr></table></div><div class='q_table'><h2>Outside of classes, many hours did you generally spend to complete/study for one...</h2> <table><tr><th></th><th>0-1 hours</th><th>1-2 hours</th><th>2-4 hours</th><th>4-6 hours</th><th>6-10 hours</th><th>10-15 hours</th><th>15+ hours</th><th>N/A</th></tr><tr><td>Homework</td><td>50.0%</td><td>50.0%</td><td>0.0%</td><td>0.0%</td><td>0.0%</td><td>0.0%</td><td>0.0%</td><td>0.0%</td></tr><tr><td>Quiz</td><td>50.0%</td><td>50.0%</td><td>0.0%</td><td>0.0%</td><td>0.0%</td><td>0.0%</td><td>0.0%</td><td>0.0%</td></tr><tr><td>Test</td><td>0.0%</td><td>0.0%</td><td>100.0%</td><td>0.0%</td><td>0.0%</td><td>0.0%</td><td>0.0%</td><td>0.0%</td></tr><tr><td>Project/Lab/Essay</td><td>0.0%</td><td>0.0%</td><td>0.0%</td><td>0.0%</td><td>100.0%</td><td>0.0%</td><td>0.0%</td><td>0.0%</td></tr><tr><td>Graded Discussion</td><td>0.0%</td><td>0.0%</td><td>0.0%</td><td>0.0%</td><td>0.0%</td><td>0.0%</td><td>0.0%</td><td>100.0%</td></tr></table></div><div class='q_table'><h2>Briefly comment on the difficulty of the course's (assessments/homework/etc) relative to your background, experience, and performance in other courses.</h2><table><tr><th>Comments</th></tr><tr><td>The main homework assignments in this class are "labs" which are essentially problem sets containing a mix of coding and theory questions.

The other type of homework is textbook readings, which can be quite long and dense. Thankfully, the in-class slides distill out the most important information, so a skim should suffice in most cases.
Quizzes can sometimes present a tricky question or two, so make sure you have a solid understanding of how all the algorithms work, and how they would handle a sample case.
Tests in this class present a particular time crunch because you have to ideate algorithms and solutions on the spot. I highly recommend working out practice problems in preparation, whether from the textbook or otherwise. Algorithms and programs usually aren't meant to be created within the span of minutes, but you'll need to do so for these tests.</td></tr><tr><td>have some surface-level experience with parts of the class. it helped but concepts are treated rigorously enough (for high school) that content is still difficult to master. </td></tr></table></div><div class='q_table'><h2>What were your favorite moments from the course?</h2><table><tr><th>Comments</th></tr><tr><td>morning warmup games were always fun especially in a first period class</td></tr></table></div><div class='q_table'><h2>Who is this course best for?</h2><table><tr><th>Comments</th></tr><tr><td>People with a keen interest in computer science, especially in algorithms, who want to take their knowledge to the next level.</td></tr><tr><td>anyone interested in cs/analytical disciplines and willing to put in the time and effort to see the beauty in cs. </td></tr></table></div><div class='q_table'><h2>Additional comments</h2><table><tr><th>Comments</th></tr><tr><td>ms. kashiwada is very nice and an amazing teacher. her course reflects this.</td></tr></table></div>

        <h1>(H) Advanced Topics in Physics, Engineering and Technology - Mr. Martinez (2 responses)</h1><p>The Advanced Topics in Physics, Engineering and Technology course taught by Mr. Martinez covers a wide range of topics including 3D statics, electrostatics, magnetism, and fluid dynamics, along with soft skills like time management and problem-solving. The course structure consists of a mix of lectures and labs, with the labs aiding in visualizing course material. Some students found the course challenging but manageable with effort and appreciated the resources provided by Mr. Martinez. The course is recommended for students interested in physics and engineering. Students mentioned that the course is more difficult than standard physics courses but can be mastered with diligence and attention to detail. In terms of workload, most students spend 1-2 hours on homework, and the class is not seen as easy compared to other courses.

However, there aren't a lot of labs for the electricity and magnetism stuff given that those concepts are harder to demonstrate.
The second semester is one big project, just like regular PET. Projects vary in terms of the computational intensity required to carry them out, but you learn a lot about the engineering process.</td></tr><tr><td>lectures were all very well explained, though the difficult nature of the content made it so that sometimes, even after paying full attention, the concepts would elude me until i reviewed after. there is an overemphasis on participation that i did not appreciate in light of this. labs are fun but not the most useful for learning. thankfully they are limited because there is a dreadfully boring, long, specific report to fill out after each of them with very rigid conventions to follow. </td></tr></table></div><div class='q_table'><h2>Please respond to the following:</h2> <table><tr><th></th><th>Mean</th><th>Median</th><th>Strongly Disagree</th><th>Disagree</th><th>Neutral</th><th>Agree</th><th>Strongly Agree</th></tr><tr><td>This course challenged me intellectually.</td><td>5.0</td><td>5.0</td><td>0.0%</td><td>0.0%</td><td>0.0%</td><td>0.0%</td><td>100.0%</td></tr><tr><td>I understood the standards for success on assignments.</td><td>3.5</td><td>3.5</td><td>0.0%</td><td>0.0%</td><td>50.0%</td><td>50.0%</td><td>0.0%</td></tr><tr><td>Class time helped me succeed.</td><td>4.5</td><td>4.5</td><td>0.0%</td><td>0.0%</td><td>0.0%</td><td>50.0%</td><td>50.0%</td></tr><tr><td>I received useful feedback on my work.</td><td>4.5</td><td>4.5</td><td>0.0%</td><td>0.0%</td><td>0.0%</td><td>50.0%</td><td>50.0%</td></tr><tr><td>My work was evaluated fairly.</td><td>4.5</td><td>4.5</td><td>0.0%</td><td>0.0%</td><td>0.0%</td><td>50.0%</td><td>50.0%</td></tr><tr><td>This course was easier than my other courses</td><td>1.5</td><td>1.5</td><td>50.0%</td><td>50.0%</td><td>0.0%</td><td>0.0%</td><td>0.0%</td></tr><tr><td>This course prepared me for the associated AP (if applicable)</td><td>3.5</td><td>3.5</td><td>0.0%</td><td>0.0%</td><td>50.0%</td><td>50.0%</td><td>0.0%</td></tr><tr><td>The instructor was available and helpful outside of class.</td><td>4.0</td><td>4.0</td><td>0.0%</td><td>0.0%</td><td>0.0%</td><td>100.0%</td><td>0.0%</td></tr><tr><td>Overall, this was an excellent course.</td><td>4.5</td><td>4.5</td><td>0.0%</td><td>0.0%</td><td>0.0%</td><td>50.0%</td><td>50.0%</td></tr><tr><td>I was interested in the subject prior to starting the course</td><td>4.0</td><td>4.0</td><td>0.0%</td><td>0.0%</td><td>0.0%</td><td>100.0%</td><td>0.0%</td></tr><tr><td>The course increased my interest in the subject</td><td>4.0</td><td>4.0</td><td>0.0%</td><td>0.0%</td><td>0.0%</td><td>100.0%</td><td>0.0%</td></tr></table></div><div class='q_table'><h2>Outside of classes, many hours did you generally spend to complete/study for one...</h2> <table><tr><th></th><th>0-1 hours</th><th>1-2 hours</th><th>2-4 hours</th><th>4-6 hours</th><th>6-10 hours</th><th>10-15 hours</th><th>15+ hours</th><th>N/A</th></tr><tr><td>Homework</td><td>0.0%</td><td>100.0%</td><td>0.0%</td><td>0.0%</td><td>0.0%</td><td>0.0%</td><td>0.0%</td><td>0.0%</td></tr><tr><td>Quiz</td><td>0.0%</td><td>0.0%</td><td>0.0%</td><td>0.0%</td><td>0.0%</td><td>0.0%</td><td>0.0%</td><td>100.0%</td></tr><tr><td>Test</td><td>0.0%</td><td>0.0%</td><td>0.0%</td><td>50.0%</td><td>50.0%</td><td>0.0%</td><td>0.0%</td><td>0.0%</td></tr><tr><td>Project/Lab/Essay</td><td>0.0%</td><td>0.0%</td><td>50.0%</td><td>50.0%</td><td>0.0%</td><td>0.0%</td><td>0.0%</td><td>0.0%</td></tr><tr><td>Graded Discussion</td><td>0.0%</td><td>0.0%</td><td>0.0%</td><td>0.0%</td><td>0.0%</td><td>0.0%</td><td>0.0%</td><td>100.0%</td></tr></table></div><div class='q_table'><h2>Briefly comment on the difficulty of the course's (assessments/homework/etc) relative to your background, experience, and performance in other courses.</h2><table><tr><th>Comments</th></tr><tr><td>This class, especially in regards to the tests, has built up a notorious reputation for being extremely difficult.

        <h1>(H)/Reg Data Analytics - Ms. Teter (1 responses)</h1><p>In the Reg Data Analytics course taught by Ms. Teter, students learned about topics like linear regression, probability, sampling, significance tests, and basic machine learning principles. The course primarily consisted of lectures, which some found to be dry and not very interactive. There were occasional group projects and long-term assignments, but students felt that they didn't always enhance their understanding due to teaching limitations. Feedback on assignments was perceived as useful and fair. Students generally found the course to be easy compared to other classes and felt adequately prepared for any associated AP exams. The instructor was considered available and helpful outside of class. This course is recommended for those interested in statistics and data science without the commitment of a full computer science course or for STEM students looking for an honors GPA boost.

As long as you stay on top of the homework, you don't really need to study for the quizzes. Tests are also pretty straightforward, and it definitely helps that you get an equation sheet and notecard for almost all of them.
That being said, Teter isn't always the most adept at teaching the new material.

        <h1>Biology - Ms. Reid (3 responses)</h1><p>In Biology taught by Ms. Reid, students highlighted learnings on cell functions, genetics, human systems, and macromolecules, with a focus on memorization-based topics like organ systems. They found the interactive assignments and labs helpful for visualizing concepts and appreciated detailed diagrams in videos. Most students found the course intellectually challenging, with fair evaluation and helpful feedback, although some felt it was easier than other courses. Students spent 0-1 hours on homework and found tests fair but project assessments strict on details. Favorite moments included labs and lab reports, with enthusiasm for Ms. Reid's storytelling.

The labs were genuinely engaging, especially for kinesthetic learners, and it was interesting to see the concepts we were talking about in class represented in real life.</td></tr><tr><td>This course is definitely more lecture-based – most of the time the teacher will go through a slideshow with the class on today's topic, and then if there's time left you can start on the homework. Other days, we'll do simple labs (like pH indicators or starch indicators) and write up a lab report as homework. Like I said, biology is very memorization-based, so I definitely think that doing slides in class helps with gaining the knowledge you need to ace the tests. </td></tr><tr><td>The videos we watched in class always included detailed diagrams which really made it easy for me to understand the topics.

Students mainly learned what they wrote about. Feedback on work was considered useful and fair, but the course was not challenging intellectually. Homework and graded discussions required minimal study time, and essay grades were initially tricky to grasp but became manageable after meeting with the instructor. Ms. Sorger's engaging teaching style and sense of humor were highlighted as favorite aspects of the course.

The homework was generally average, but it took a much longer time than needed, especially the first few in the unit. The first few were also generally harder than the last few.
