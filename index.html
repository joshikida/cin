        <h1>(H) Advanced Topics in Physics, Engineering and Technology - Mr. Martinez (3 responses)</h1><p>Students in Mr. Martinez's Advanced Topics in Physics, Engineering, and Technology course appreciated the rigorous teaching of topics like 3D statics, electrostatics, magnetism, and fluid dynamics, as well as the development of crucial soft skills. The course was intellectually challenging, receiving perfect scores in this regard, and was deemed one of the hardest classes compared to others. While aspects like lectures and labs were generally helpful, students often relied on self-study for deeper understanding, feeling that preparation and participation were key for success. The second semester's project-based approach provided hands-on learning in engineering. Exams and lab reports were noted as particularly demanding, but achievable with thorough preparation. The course received high marks for overall quality and fairness, though it could better prepare students for related AP exams. This class is best suited for those seriously interested in physics and engineering and willing to put in significant effort.</p><div class='q_table'><h2>What are the most important things that you learned in this course?</h2><table><tr><th>Comments</th></tr><tr><td>3D statics using vectors/cross products, electrostatics (Gauss' Law), magnetism (Ampere's Law and Faraday's Law), fluid dynamics, good engineering practices.</td></tr><tr><td>most of e&m, but also teaches soft skills like time-management and problem solving to a level that most probably haven't experienced before</td></tr><tr><td>How to approach and solve calculus-based problems in Mechanics, Electricity, and Magnetism. Also, how to use shop tools and complete a complex engineering project.</td></tr></table></div><div class='q_table'><h2>Briefly describe how aspects of this course (lectures, discussions, labs, assignments, etc.) contributed to your learning.</h2><table><tr><th>Comments</th></tr><tr><td>The first semester is largely a mix of lectures and labs. Since the lectures are rather fast-paced, the labs (when they do happen) help a lot with visualizing and internalizing the material. However, there aren't a lot of labs for the electricity and magnetism stuff given that those concepts are harder to demonstrate.
The second semester is one big project, just like regular PET. Projects vary in terms of the computational intensity required to carry them out, but you learn a lot about the engineering process.</td></tr><tr><td>lectures were all very well explained, though the difficult nature of the content made it so that sometimes, even after paying full attention, the concepts would elude me until i reviewed after. there is an overemphasis on participation that i did not appreciate in light of this. labs are fun but not the most useful for learning. thankfully they are limited because there is a dreadfully boring, long, specific report to fill out after each of them with very rigid conventions to follow. </td></tr><tr><td>The lectures were generally helpful, but I usually had to self-study to understand the material.</td></tr></table></div><div class='q_table'><h2>Please respond to the following:</h2> <table><tr><th></th><th>Mean</th><th>Median</th><th>S.

        <h1>(H) Math III - Dr. Parsons (7 responses)</h1><p>Dr. Parsons' (H) Math III course is described as challenging and demanding, with a focus on perseverance, algebra, trigonometry, and problem-solving skills. Students appreciated the in-depth and collaborative nature of the lectures, group work, and assignments, which significantly contributed to their understanding. The course was noted for its intellectual rigor, with a high workload and tough tests, although homework was generally manageable. Students felt well-supported, receiving fair evaluations and useful feedback. Out-of-class help from Dr. Parsons was praised. The course is ideal for students deeply interested in math or planning to pursue STEM fields, willing to commit significant study time. While the course increased students' interest in math, the associated AP preparedness was less clear. Dr. Parsons is highly regarded, but some suggest additional support, such as a dedicated math coach.</p><div class='q_table'><h2>What are the most important things that you learned in this course?</h2><table><tr><th>Comments</th></tr><tr><td>Perseverance and the value of hard work – Honors III Math is a tough class with a high workload and demanding tests and quizzes; the most important thing it taught me was to stay consistent and keep working no matter what. </td></tr><tr><td>Just Algebra II topics.

In this regard, I would say that this course might've been easier for me than for other people. Also, because I took it in freshmen year, I had more time on my hands to study, which probably helped me get higher grades. </td></tr><tr><td>Homework was decently difficult (one hour every night because it is an honors class). Assessments were pretty hard. I think if you took Math 2A in the Middle School it prepares you well, but I know the class is usually harder for students who took Math 2A in the Upper School. However, when I did the review problems provided with Dr. Parsons assessments went well.</td></tr><tr><td>test are hard, but if you do the review and understand the concepts, they will be a lot easier</td></tr><tr><td>Very difficult material, tests are challenging, heavy homework load.</td></tr><tr><td>The course's homework load was moderate compared to my other classes, generally more than the rest of my freshman courses. The tests, however, were a lot harder, and rigorous preparation was required for these tests unlike other classes.</td></tr><tr><td>Quizzes were time-crunches but the difficulty was around textbook HW problem level. The tests in (H) Math III were the hardest tests I took at Crystal. Very very tricky problems that required using out-of-the-box thinking to solve problems unlike any others you had seen before.</td></tr><tr><td>The assessments are relatively paced and have a normal difficulty.

        <h1>Biology - Ms. Reid (6 responses)</h1><p>Students appreciated Ms. Reid's biology course, highlighting key learnings in cell functions, human systems, genetics, and evolution. Interactive assignments, slides, and engaging labs were particularly helpful in understanding and applying concepts. The course heavily relies on memorization and lectures but includes valuable labs and assignments. Students felt challenged but well-supported, with useful feedback from the teacher. Generally, homework was manageable, taking less than an hour, and quizzes and tests were moderately difficult. Favorite moments included labs, particularly dissections and engaging in-class activities like Kahoot. This course is suitable for students interested in understanding biological processes and living systems.</p><div class='q_table'><h2>What are the most important things that you learned in this course?</h2><table><tr><th>Comments</th></tr><tr><td>We learned about cell organelles and functions of the cell (such as cell transport and mitosis), genetics/inheritance, human systems, and macromolecules. To me, the most significant portions were those about the human systems and functions of the cell. Either that or they're the ones I remember with the most clarity.</td></tr><tr><td>This course gives a very broad overview of a lot of basic topics in biology, like human systems, photosynthesis, reproduction, etc. Towards the end of the year, we focused mostly on organ systems – which is what I personally remember the most of. </td></tr><tr><td>I think evolution and genetics were the most important units we learned last year.</td></tr><tr><td>LOTS! Cellular structure, human systems</td></tr><tr><td>Human systems.</td></tr><tr><td>Human reproductive system was very useful. Learning about how our body works (ex. Nervous System) was also very useful.</td></tr></table></div><div class='q_table'><h2>Briefly describe how aspects of this course (lectures, discussions, labs, assignments, etc.) contributed to your learning.</h2><table><tr><th>Comments</th></tr><tr><td>The in-class interactive assignments helped me visualize trickier concepts, and the slides were informative. The labs were genuinely engaging, especially for kinesthetic learners, and it was interesting to see the concepts we were talking about in class represented in real life.</td></tr><tr><td>This course is definitely more lecture-based – most of the time the teacher will go through a slideshow with the class on today's topic, and then if there's time left you can start on the homework. Other days, we'll do simple labs (like pH indicators or starch indicators) and write up a lab report as homework. Like I said, biology is very memorization-based, so I definitely think that doing slides in class helps with gaining the knowledge you need to ace the tests. </td></tr><tr><td>The videos we watched in class always included detailed diagrams which really made it easy for me to understand the topics. I loved ever lab and lab report we did, it really helped me with my scientific writing and it was a lot of fun. I don’t think the lectures were perfect for me, but ever other aspect contributed to my knowledge of the subject as a whole.</td></tr><tr><td>mainly lecture based, pretty helpful, may need to restudy for quizzes and tests; labs were super fun and learned a lot from hands-on experience; I felt the homework was mostly busy-work and stuff we learned in class</td></tr><tr><td>I really liked the dissections and labs.</td></tr><tr><td>It contributed to my learning because it will help me in nature. I can know go out into the world and understand how everything works.</td></tr></table></div><div class='q_table'><h2>Please respond to the following:</h2> <table><tr><th></th><th>Mean</th><th>Median</th><th>S.

The tests are graded fairly, but on the project assessments there were a lot of points taken off for minute details. The homework was easy, as long as you pay attention in class, and as long as you make a basic study guide for each test you'll be fine.</td></tr><tr><td>I had never taken biology before, but because it's a course that focuses on having you memorize things, I would say that you don't really need any prior experience to do well as long as you invest the time outside of class to review material. </td></tr><tr><td>I honestly did not think that biology was a hard course at all, but many would probably disagree with me. Compared to Math III H, the homework was significantly less. Regardless, this was definitely my favorite class.</td></tr><tr><td>Homework usually took me 30-45 minutes, in my opinion, quizzes were harder than tests; more frequent assessments than other classes.</td></tr><tr><td>Tests were hard, but quizzes were tricky.</td></tr><tr><td>Compared to my other courses I personally find this classes homework and assessments easier than other classes. However I know I am definitely in the minority for this as I know much of the grade believes that this is a hard class.</td></tr></table></div><div class='q_table'><h2>What were your favorite moments from the course?</h2><table><tr><th>Comments</th></tr><tr><td>I liked the sickle-cell anemia gel electrophoresis lab.</td></tr><tr><td>Ms. Reid's stories!

I really enjoyed drawing diagrams for my reports and writing about all of my findings. It didn’t even feel like homework for me.</td></tr><tr><td>Kahoots!</td></tr><tr><td>Fetal pig dissection was very interesting and I learned a lot.</td></tr><tr><td>I really enjoyed our dissection. Despite looking and smelling absolutely disgusting, I learned a lot about our insides, how they work, and what they look like.</td></tr></table></div><div class='q_table'><h2>Who is this course best for?</h2><table><tr><th>Comments</th></tr><tr><td>People who like learning about how the world works, and especially living things. Also people who are mature enough to not giggle at the mention of certain organs.</td></tr><tr><td>I think everyone needs a basic understanding of biological processes, anatomy, and evolution.</td></tr><tr><td>This course is best for 9th graders cause it’s forced. This courses is also is great for someone who would like to learn about how everything works around them.</td></tr></table></div><div class='q_table'><h2>Additional comments</h2><table><tr><th>Comments</th></tr><tr><td>If theres a Spanish or comp science it’s prob mine</td></tr></table></div>
